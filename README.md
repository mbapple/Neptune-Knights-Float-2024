This is the code for the UCF MER Knights team, Neptune Knights' float for the 2024 MATE competition.
The float is controlled by an ESP32 dev board. The board creates a WiFi server accessible on the laptop. From the server, the user can deplpoy the float, stop the float, and display the data to a web serial monitor. The data is displayed as time and depth in a format that can be copied to a CSV file for viewing.
